Note:
    [1]: A net cannot be modified for repair if:
         - it is hardwired, preserved, or global;
         - the sink pin is a clock pin;
         - the sink pin has negative max-delay slack allowance;

    [2]: A location is not feasible for inserting a delay buffer if the estimated minimum delay to be inserted might exceed the max-delay slack allowance of the sink pin.

    [3]: The I/O delay taps cannot be used to fix hold violations in RTG4 design if it is a MSIO or MSIOD that drives a GB.
